The Squishy gateware library is broken into three main parts. The first is the [`squishy.gateware.core`](./core/index.md) module, this contains all of the core infra for squishy. Next is the [`squishy.gateware.platform`](./platform/index.md) module, this contains the Amaranth platform definitions for various bits of squishy hardware. Finally there is the [`squishy.gateware.scsi`](./scsi/index.md) module, this is where all of the SCSI machinery is for use in Amaranth HDL projects.
