# CLI

The CLI is the main way to interact with squishy, most references to interacting with Squishy will assume you are using the CLI.

## Invocation

To invoke the squishy CLI, you can simply run the `squishy` command if you have squishy installed to your system, or if you are using it out of a clone of the repo, invoking `python squishy.py` in the root of the repository will have the same effect.
